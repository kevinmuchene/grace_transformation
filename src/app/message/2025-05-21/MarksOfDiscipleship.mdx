<Passage passageId="JHN.1.35-JHN.1.36" reading="John 1 : 35 - 36" />

Discipleship commences with an Encounter with Jesus.

In this Case, John the Baptist pointed his disciples to Jesus identifying him as The Lamb of God.

Later `(John 3:30)` John states “He must increase, but I must decrease” signifying his recognition of The Lordship and influence of Jesus Christ

<span className="color-blue">`37 : The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus`</span>

Upon hearing about Jesus, true disciples will follow Jesus. 
The act of following is not just physical but all encompassing to one who follows (Luke 5:11)

In `1 Kings 19:19-21` Elisha follows Elijah

<Passage passageId="1KI.19.19-1KI.19.21" reading="1st Kings : 19 - 21" />

Elisha was busy working on his field when Elijah threw a mantle on him - Symbolic of a call

Elisha understood what this meant and ran towards Elisha - Acceptance of Call

Elisha was ready to lay down his life for the call - kiss his father&mother goodbye and Slaughter his oxen and gave it up to receive the call and Rose and Followed Elijah Became his Servant 

`38 : Then Jesus turned, and seeing them following, said to them, "What do you seek?" They said to Him, "Rabbi" (which is to say, when translated, Teacher), "where are You staying?"`
`39 : He said to them, "Come and see." They came and saw where He was staying, and remained with Him that day (now it was about the tenth hour)`

A true disciple of Jesus will Spend Time with Jesus

Jesus has asked them what intention they had- “what do you seek?”

The disciples recognized him as teacher `Rabbi`

The disciples were ready to go to where he was staying and they did

The disciples stayed/remained with him - this is the essence of discipleship . 

## Spending time with Jesus 
When you spend time with Jesus , your life does not remain the same `(Acts 4:13)`


`40 : One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.`
`41 : He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which is translated, the Christ).`

A true disciple of Jesus will witness to others about Jesus (Andrew told and brought his brother Peter to Jesus)

Andrew brought boy with his lunch to Jesus (John 6:8-11)

Andrew brought the Greeks (John 12:20-23) to Jesus

The great Commission is a call for us to go and make disciples of all nations (Matthew 28:18-20)

`42 : And he brought him to Jesus. Now when Jesus looked at him, He said, "You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas" (which is translated, A Stone)`

Once you bring people to Jesus , it is Jesus who changes their lives and destiny.

Jesus saw the Potential in Simon.

Change was not just in name but in character and destiny “You are ….You shall be!”.

Only Jesus wields the power to change people’s lives and destinies (1 Cor 3:6 ‘I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase.’)

Keep bringing the Peters to Jesus , he will make them Cephas’
